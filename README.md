#GRIBsherpa
GRIBsherpa is a tool that gathers meteorological forecast data for the use in a wildfire prediction tool. The program will query, schedule, download, extract, verify and store meteorological data in a database for real time and historical analysis.  The project will be written in python.  Contributions welcome.

##Installation
The first steps for using these tools involve installing necessary dependencies.  A shell script is provided in this repo which can be run from the command-line and will install all necessary dependencies.  If you would like to manually install these, refer to this script for details.  As this project is developed and run on a virtual machine, this script is the latest/most up-to-date way that the dependencies are being installed.  There is also a working [virtual machine](www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) image available [here](ADD THIS LINK) that has all these dependencies already installed.  **Note** that issues were encountered when trying to install on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and therefore the latest version of Ubuntu available at the time, 13.04 was used for this project.  If you are building manually it is recommended that Ubuntu 13.04 is used (or you can try an even more recent version if one is available).
